<h4>Concept and execution</h4>
For this mini exercise I ended up designing 2 different types of throbbers/preload animations. The reason for that was that my original plan (PLAN A) turned out to be a bit of a challenge for me, so I briefly decided to trash the idea and then started to play around with the throbber code provided by our lecturer and ended up with PLAN B. 

When PLAN B succeeded I decided to return to PLAN A as it bothered me that I couldn't make it work. With a little help from both a classmate and our instructor I finally got the animation of the doggy's pee to work. I ended up liking both programmes so I decided to just upload both.

I wanted to make some preload animations that were entertaining to watch - I personally find that if the throbber or preload animations is boring I get impatient really quickly.

<h4>How can programme reflect on cultural issues?</h4>
I think that since the throbber somehow becomes a synonym to latency, we could perhaps achieve an understanding from the user of the device wherein the throbber appears through programming, by somehow allowing him or her to have a peek into the actual data. If the users were actually able to see, read and understand the data, the code or whatever runs the device, they would be be both more understanding but also more participating in the software culture they live in.
