<h3>Concept and execution</h3>
For this mini exercise I ended up designing 2 different types of throbbers/preload animations. The reason for that was that my original plan (PLAN A) turned out to be a bit of a challenge for me, so I briefly decided to trash the idea and then started to play around with the throbber code provided by our lecturer and ended up with PLAN B. 

When PLAN B succeeded I decided to return to PLAN A as it bothered me that I couldn't make it work. With a little help from both a classmate and our instructor I finally got the animation of the doggy's pee to work. I ended up liking both programmes so I decided to just upload both.

I wanted to make some preload animations that were entertaining to watch - I personally find that if the throbber or preload animations is boring I get impatient really quickly.
