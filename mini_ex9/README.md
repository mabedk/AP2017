<b>Run: OBS: For some reason Github won't allow the programme to run due to some HTTPS problems, therefore you will need to download both the index file and mini_ex9.js file and paste those files into a working p5.js folder to run the programme! Or ells you will not get the same result as the screenshot</b> https://rawgit.com/mabedk/AP2017/gh-pages/mini_ex9/empty-example/index.html. 

<b>API chosen:</b> Open Weather. We chose the open weather API as we had challenges in achieving our original plan. Open weather was used by Daniel Shiffman and we found that his explanation was really good.

<h4>Programme Agenda</h4>
We've created a programme that shows the temperature in four different countries, visualised through pink blobs/circles. For each blob a botton with the countries' name on it is attached and when clicking the button, the degrees will be shown in celcius. 

<h4>Process</h4> 
This mini exercise was definitely the most difficult for me. Emma and I had so many troubles getting the API to work with our intended plan as the JSON data didn't have a title in the first API we encountered and therefore we weren't able to call the JSON object in the code. Second time around when we started on this programme we found it to be easier if we simply followed Daniel Shiffman's example - which annoyed both of us a great deal as we really wanted to succeed with our original plan. 

I find code to be frustrating in general, but working with API is by far the most frustrating apsect of code I've encountered.
