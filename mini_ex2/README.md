<center><h3>My humble programme and errors</h3></center>
I wanted to create something that represented my reflections of what an error is. To me, an error is when in the midst of accomplishing something - a goal or a task - you fail. I think the effect of the error is satisfactory when you learn from it, perhaps even fail again and again before accomplishing the goal or task. Errors are means for developing a adequate outcome.

As I am yet to be a programmer-champion, I decided to keep my programme simple. Turned out it was not as simple as I thought though as I ended up struggling with the <span style="color:#6495ED">mouseClicked()</span> function - I failed again and again and again until I finally figured it out with some help from one of our instructors. I personally think that's the beauty of errors - if we accept them and turn to others for help they can somehow unite us. All in all the coding progress of this programme was filled with errors - and frustration.

As for what essientially constitutes a programme I'd say programming. I'm sure my answer will develip throughout this semester, but as of right now this mini-exercise has opened my eyes for just how much coding-work is behind something as simple as my humble programme. I can't even imagine how much code is behind something like games, opperating systems, apps and even websites like Facebook and Google.
