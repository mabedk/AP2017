<center><h4>About the Programme And General Reflections</h4></center>
I wanted to create something that represented my reflections of what an error is. To me, an error is when in the midst of accomplishing something - a goal or a task - you fail. I think the effect of the error is satisfactory when you learn from it, perhaps even fail again and again before accomplishing the goal or task. Errors are means for developing a adequate outcome.

As I am yet to be a programmer-champion, I decided to keep my programme simple. Turned out it was not as simple as I thought though as I ended up struggling with the <span style="color:#6495ED">mouseClicked()</span> function - I failed again and again and again until I finally figured it out with some help from one of our instructors. I personally think that's the beauty of errors - if we accept them and turn to others for help they can somehow unite us. 

The programme encourage you to click away the error - the error in this programme's case is the fact that one of the circles is another color than the rest of them. By clicking on the circle it changes from red to green. Clicking it again changes the color from green to blue - and clicking it again changes the color from blue to, finally, white. The circle ends up matching the other circles even though it takes three clicks (and even though this may not seem like a long time or a lot of tries, the piece turns into 'perfection' in the end).

<center><h4>What Constitutes a Programme?</h4></center>
As for what essientially constitutes a programme I'd say programming. I'm sure my answer will develop throughout this semester, but as of right now this mini-exercise has opened my eyes for just how much coding-work is behind something as simple as my humble programme. I can't even imagine how much code is behind something like games, opperating systems, apps and even websites like Facebook and Google.

<center><h4>Tim Baker And How He Changed My Understanding of Error</h4></center>
I wrote the above reflection and account before reading the article <i>Error, The Unforeseen and The Emergent</i> by Tim Baker. After having read his account of errors and their potential, I think I should reconsider my relationship to errors and the frustration they create for me. Baker proclaims that errors are unavoidable and instead of proceeding to work against them, we should consider working with and embracing them. He argues that since errors mark the potential of the new and unforeseen, they hold great potential as well - by trying to work around them we work around possible qualities we wouldn't have discovered without the occuring of those errors. I definitely find this way of thinking interesting and I'm certain I'll consider this argument the next time I'm ready to punch a hole through my screen because of reoccuring errors in my code.
