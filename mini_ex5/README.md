(The programme generates four line poems from the titles of Queen songs)

I actually didn't use any RiTa Library functions for this exercise, because I was really interested in working with source materials. My original plan was to have a video playing behind the generated poem, but even though I actually got the video to work, I sadly couldn't get the text to be shown above the video. So instead I tried working with images. Therefore my experience is a bit ambigious as I didn't feel very succesful with the video function.
