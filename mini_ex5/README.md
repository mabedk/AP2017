<h4>My experience working with RiTa Library and found text as souce materials</h4>

I actually didn't use any RiTa Library functions for this exercise, because I was really interested in working with source materials. I did however try out some of the functions and thought it was a tiny bit difficult. My original plan was to have a video playing behind the generated poem, but even though I actually got the video to work, I sadly couldn't get the text to be shown above the video - and after having approximately six people trying to help me, I gave up. So instead I tried working with images. Therefore my experience is a bit ambigious as I didn't feel very succesful with the video function, but made the library work.

<h4>How might we think about the materiality of text/interface?</h4>

Perhaps through interaction. Based on the text *The Aesthetics of Materiality in Electronic Literature* by Serge Bouchardon, my understanding of the materiality of text is through the manipulation of said form - if the reader is able to manipulate the text, he or she will also be able to "grasp" it. As for interfaces my understnading is also based on mentioned text and the materility is visible through the material figures - if the user is able to identify the figures in the interface perhaps they'll gain a notion of materiality.
