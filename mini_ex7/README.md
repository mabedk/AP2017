<h4>Programme agenda</h4>
For some reason I struggled a lot with this mini exercise. I decided to take Daniel Shiffman's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMsD3IigG7g&t=283s">Slider Dance code</a> and make it interactive through checkboxes. Only when I was done I realized that we were supposed to incorporate objects in our code and I hadn't made any objects apart from the ones from dom library. So I started a new project where I turned the dom library sliders into objects through constructor functions, but I couldn't make the interactivity work and as I had no one to ask for help I ended up letting the idea go. Maybe I'll finish it next week during instructor classes - I'll add a screenshot of this unfinished project as well just because I can lol:

<h4>Object advantages/limitations</h4>
I felt extremely limited because of the form art rule for this mini exercise - the rule that said that we had to use the objects from the dom library. For some reason I didn't like using objects that had been created beforehand even though it's nice to have the opportunity to do so. The advantanges however is definitely that you don't necessarily have to create checkboxes or sliders by yourself. However I think the advantages of objects you create for yourself is multiple as you don't have to write the same piece of code over and over, but can do iteration through a constructor function.
