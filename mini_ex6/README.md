<h4>Programme agenda</h4>
The idea behind the programme is to challenge our understanding of fundamental things like circles - a circle is not necessarily bound to the shape round just because we're told in school that it is, or at least not in the world of software. The function 'ellipse' is called to create the circles and so the code generates a different shape than a human's basic understanding of what a circle is. 

<h4>Programme Rules</h4>
1. The circles are created at a random location each time programme is run.

2. Every time the programme runs through draw, the circles' width and height gets bigger by 1.

3. The circles' height starts at 20 but the windowHeight is then substracted - this is what makes the circles look different than actual circles when programme is run.

4. When the circles' width is bigger than or equal to 2000 they get smaller and if the width is smaller than or equal to 2 they get bigger.

<h4>How the programme expresses generativity</h4>
I believe my programme expresses the notion of generativity as it is a autonomous system, which generates something on its own due to the code enscribed to it. Also, I would argue that my programme also expresses an emergent behavior as something addtional is created each time a frame is run. In relation to complexity my programme exhibit a bit of chaos as the location of the circles is unpredictable, due to the random function, each time the programme is refreshed - therefore the result of the programme consists of a small difference, which according to Galanter is what makes a programme difficult to predict over time. For sure the programme could’ve exhibited even more complexity and chaos if the circles’ width and height had complex parameters implemented, such as random.
