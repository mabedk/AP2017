<b>Run:</b> https://rawgit.com/mabedk/AP2017/gh-pages/mini_ex6/mini-ex6-this%20is%20circles./index.html

<h4>Programme Rules</h4>
1. The circles are created at a random location each time programme is run.

2. Every time the programme runs through draw, the circles' width and height gets bigger by 1.

3. The circles' height starts at 20 but the windowHeight is then substracted - this is what makes the circles look different than actual circles when programme is run.

4. When the circles' width is bigger than or equal to 2000 they get smaller and if the width is smaller than or equal to 2 they get bigger.
