Remember kids: You donâ€™t necessarily have to drink alcohol to have a party, all you have to do is play the music and take a ride with the party bus! 

The Party Bus demonstrates the notion of feedback as it continuously runs from one edge of the canvas to the other, and the changes happening when you press the sun.

*Note to self: Sound. Never use sound again.*
