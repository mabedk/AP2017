Remember kids: You donâ€™t necessarily have to drink alcohol to have a party, all you have to do is play the music and take a ride with the party bus! 

The Party Bus demonstrates the notion of feedback as it continuously runs from one edge of the canvas to the other - it loops over and over again, even when interrupted by the changes that happens when you press the sun. 

*Note to self: Sound. Never use sound again.*
