<h4>Programme agenda</h4>
For this mini exercise I decided to work with the Blobby coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman. We were supposed to add a function/syntax to one of the challenges and I decided to add a show/hide function (even though that's not the actual syntax of the function that does just that - look at my flowchart for more detail) and change up the color palette.

<h4>Difficulty of this mini exercise</h4>
For me, one of the difficulties during this week's mini ex was using someone ells' code. Of course Daniel Shiffman explains his code throughout his video turtorials, but it was still sometimes troubling trying to decrypt and understand a code you didn't write yourself. As a matter of fact I actually started out with one of his more detailed coding challenges, but ended up finding it way too difficult to keep up, keeping in mind that I had to be able to create a flowchart of the whole thing - and my goal was to create a flowchart even my mum (with no coding experience whatsoever) could understand. 

This leads me to the second difficulty - the flowchart. It was surprisingly difficult to break down the code and try to make sense of it so a person who have never seen code before could understand, <b>but</b> when I was done and was satisfied with the result I found myself with a brand new understanding of Shiffman's code.

<h4>What we may achieve through a flowchart</h4>
First off, the flowchart is a simple yet extremely helpful tool to understand your own code - and others'! The comments in a code is rarely enough for me to understand the syntax or why the programmor decided to do as he or she did, but through a flowchart you achieve a organised break down and deeper understanding of a piece of code. Difficult pieces of code (such as a for loop) can be rephrased in a simple manner through visual representation, which isn't dependent on the math, logic and numbers that the code is tied to and therefore it's easier to both explain and comprehend the code.  

But the flowchart isn't limited to visualise only code, more generally it visualises processes and makes it possible to clarify the ideal situation/reality of that process.
